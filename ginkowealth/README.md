# Project 0

Become more comfortable with HTML and CSS to design and style webpages.
Learn to use SCSS to write more complex stylesheets for your webpages.

# Organization

Several Webpages promoting a GinKo PLATEFORM as an alternative to the expensive and not retirement compatible current offer

Current imbroglio
- high savings and high needs for retirement
- millenials need a new offer
- reminder of safe investment principles 
- current offer is far from meeting these requirements
- pages: imbroglio.html / millenials.html / bestpractices.html  

Only a plateform with labelled solutions can meet these unsatisfied needs
- description of 2 long term / all-weather retirement allocation process
- page: ouroffer.html
